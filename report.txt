now see what happens if we try to get the links with two initial pages.

some variables have value "login to see". Let's investigate that. We need to login. Don't see what we can do about that (we will not make the robot login?).

So the process is pretty simple :

- get all brand links.
- put them in a file
- use carlinks to get all links
- use cars to get all cars

I need to have a strategy to crawl step by step. I can't have an internet connection on my PC 24/24.
--> Write a script that takes one brand as input and then gets the links and the cars.

- let's explore the page with scrapy shell

- Actually, the way the links are written are pretty simple. We may not need a spider to do that.

- For the electric motor variable, maybe it denotes the presence of an electric motor, or several of them, thus we could turn this info in a variable that counts the number of instances of it in the jsonl

- Important : understand what happens when several variables have the same name in a car page.
