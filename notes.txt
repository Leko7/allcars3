Potential works

- Replace strings with numeric values when possible, eventually decoupling (e.g. 'speed' '225 km/h | 139.81 mph' --> 'speed (km/h)' 225, 'speed (mph)' 225)
-

Issues 
- Angle columns present 'Â°' character
- Some colums have 'Log in to see' as value (eg. Engine oil specification, 
- Check if there are some columns with all entries = nan:  'Electric motor 1' and 'Electric motor 2' (manage subsection name written as variables)

Solved Issues
- Change the name of the image to get the biggest size available (delete '_thumb' and changed 'small' to 'big')
